# Debug Guide: Add Blog Button Not Working

## Issue Analysis
The Add Blog button appears but is not working. This could be due to several reasons:

## Potential Issues and Solutions

### 1. Authentication Guard Issue (FIXED)
**Problem**: The authentication guard was not properly handling role checks asynchronously.
**Solution**: Updated `isAuthenticatedGuard` to properly use `switchMap` and handle role checking.

### 2. Node.js Not Installed
**Problem**: The terminal shows "Node.js ist nicht installiert" (Node.js not installed).
**Solution**: Install Node.js to run the application.

### 3. Authentication Not Working
**Problem**: User might not be authenticated or doesn't have the required 'user' role.
**Solution**: Check authentication status and user roles.

## Debug Steps

### Step 1: Check Console Logs
When clicking the Add Blog button, check the browser console for:
- "Add Blog button clicked, navigating to /add-blog"
- "Navigation successful: true" or "Navigation failed: [error]"

### Step 2: Check Authentication Status
1. Open browser developer tools
2. Go to Application/Storage tab
3. Check if there are any OIDC tokens stored
4. Check if user is authenticated

### Step 3: Check User Roles
1. In the console, run:
```javascript
// Check if user data is available
console.log('User data:', window.localStorage.getItem('oidc.user:angular-blog-client'));
```

### Step 4: Test Navigation Manually
1. Try navigating directly to `/add-blog` in the browser
2. Check if the route loads or if there are any errors

## Code Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Authentication Guard
- Updated `src/app/core/guards/is-authenticated.guard.ts`
- Properly handles async role checking
- Uses `switchMap` instead of `map` for proper async handling

### 2. Added Debug Logging
- Added console logs to `onAddBlog()` method
- Logs navigation success/failure

### 3. Button Implementation
- Added Add Blog button to blog overview page
- Added navigation method
- Added proper styling and responsive design

## Testing the Fix

### Without Running the App
1. Check that all files are properly saved
2. Verify no TypeScript compilation errors
3. Check that imports are correct

### With Running the App
1. Start the application
2. Navigate to the blog overview page
3. Click the "Neuer Post" button
4. Check console logs
5. Verify navigation works

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Button Click Not Registered
**Cause**: Event binding not working
**Solution**: Check that `(click)="onAddBlog()"` is properly bound

### Issue: Navigation Fails
**Cause**: Route not found or authentication issues
**Solution**: Check routing configuration and authentication

### Issue: Authentication Redirect Loop
**Cause**: OIDC configuration issues
**Solution**: Check auth config and ensure proper setup

### Issue: Role Check Fails
**Cause**: User doesn't have 'user' role
**Solution**: Check user roles in Keycloak or authentication provider

## Next Steps

1. Install Node.js if not already installed
2. Run the application
3. Test the Add Blog button
4. Check console logs for any errors
5. Verify authentication and role checking

## Files Modified

1. `src/app/core/guards/is-authenticated.guard.ts` - Fixed async role checking
2. `src/app/features/blog-overview/components/blog-overview-container/blog-overview-container.component.ts` - Added navigation method with logging
3. `src/app/features/blog-overview/components/blog-overview-container/blog-overview-container.component.html` - Added Add Blog button
4. `src/app/features/blog-overview/components/blog-overview-container/blog-overview-container.component.scss` - Added button styling
5. `src/app/core/layout/header/header.component.ts` - Cleaned up navigation items

The main issue was likely the authentication guard not properly handling the role check asynchronously. This has been fixed.
